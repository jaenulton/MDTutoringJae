  <p>With the beginning of the school year rearing it's head around the corner we believe 
  it's so important to get our students started off on the right track. MD Tutoring is partnering 
with the Emilio Miyares Police Memorial Foundation to give students of families in need a bookbag 
filled with supplies to start the new year!</p>
<p>Starting July 1st, MD Tiutoring will donate $5 for every tutoring session purchased. In addition, 
  we will be accepting monetary and supply donations until August 15. For families that wish to 
  donate a bookbag, please email or contact us for a complete list of supplies needed per bookbag.</p>
